== QMK Keymaps for the M-Star Classic

The M-Star Classic PCB requires the corresponding keymap for your particular
"Model M" to be loaded in order to function correctly.

Confirmed working keymaps:

default::
       "Generic" Model M matrix -- works with US 101/102 Terminal M, 1391401, SSK*, etc
ssk::
       Same as default, except adds "numlock" layer found on Tenkey-less (TKL) "SSK" style Model Ms

j7000::
	Layout for Model M 122 "for AT computers" 13917000

m122::
	Layout for M122 "terminal" style Model Ms. Note that there are many
	keycap variants of this keyboard and this key map may need to be
	adjusted to your liking.
